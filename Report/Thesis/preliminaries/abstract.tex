\begin{abstract}
This LaTeX template was put together by the student \textsc{Jabir Ali Ouassou} $\langle$\url{jabirali@switzerlandmail.ch}$\rangle$ while working on a Master's project in 2014.
I'm sharing this template because a few people have asked me about tips regarding writing a thesis in LaTeX, and I hope that my work can be of some use to others as well.
If you find the template useful, then I would really appreciate it if you gave me some credit for my work, such as a short mention in the acknowledgements of your document. But this is of course a request, not a requirement; you're free to share the template with whomever you want, and do whatever you want with it, without my permission.

If you're using a Linux system, then you should start by installing a full LaTeX distribution such as \texttt{texlive-full}.
After that, you can use the accompanying \texttt{Makefile} to compile the LaTeX document; this means that you just have to open a terminal, use \texttt{cd /wherever/the/template/is/}, and then run \texttt{make} to compile the document.
On all the common desktop platforms, you should also be able to install an integrated development environment for LaTeX such as \url{http://texstudio.sourceforge.net}, which allows you to compile the document straight from the graphical interface.
However, be aware that some development environments may require additional configuration to work well with \texttt{bibtex}, \texttt{biblatex}, and \texttt{makeidx}.
