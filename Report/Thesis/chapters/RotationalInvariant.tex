\sectionmark{Rotational Invariant Constraint-Driven Regularization}
Zimmer et. al \cite{zimmer2011optic} argued that the directional information coming from the eigenvectors $\textbf{s}_1$ and $\textbf{s}_2$ are inconsistent with the imposed constraints on the data term $M(u,v)$ if the $M(u,v)$ is designed to take into account the constraints (\ref{gca_constraint}) coming from the gradient constancy assumption. They opted for a regularization term that instead of steering the diffusion process along the image edges, steers the diffusion along constraint edges, defined by the eigenvectors $\textbf{r}_1$ and $\textbf{r}_2$ of the regularization matrix
\begin{align}
R_{\mu} = K_{\mu} * \left[ \theta_0(\nabla f \nabla f^T) + \gamma \left( \theta_x(\nabla f_x \nabla f_x^T) + \theta_y(\nabla f_y \nabla f_y^T) \right) \right].
\end{align}
