ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE

This LaTeX template was put together by the student Jabir Ali Ouassou
<jabirali(at)switzerlandmail.ch> while working on a Master’s project in 2014.
I’m sharing this template because a few people have asked me about tips
regarding writing a thesis in LaTeX, and I hope that my work can be of some
use to others as well. If you find the template useful, then I would really
appreciate it if you gave me some credit for my work, such as a short mention
in the acknowledgements of your document. But this is of course a request, not
a requirement; you’re free to share the template with whomever you want, and
do whatever you want with it, without my permission.

If you’re using a Linux system, then you should start by installing a full
LaTeX distribution such as texlive-full. After that, you can use the accom-
panying Makefile to compile the LaTeX document; this means that you just
have to open a terminal, use cd /wherever/the/template/is/, and then run
make to compile the document. On all the common desktop platforms, you
should also be able to install an integrated development environment for LaTeX
such as http://texstudio.sourceforge.net, which allows you to compile
the document straight from the graphical interface. However, be aware that
some development environments may require additional configuration to work
well with bibtex, biblatex, and makeidx.



STRUCTURE OF THE TEMPLATE

master.tex:
	This is the master document which is compiled by LaTeX. This file is
	where you refer to all the other LaTeX files that are a part of the,
	and also where you define the metadata such as the author, supervisor,
	and title of the document.

master.ist:
	This file contains the style for the index that will appear at the back
	of the document. You probably won't need to touch this file. You can add
	entries to the index by using the macro \index{...} in your regular .tex
	files.

library.bib:
	This is a BibTeX file that contains a database over all the books and
	papers that you intend to cite. Only references that are actually used will
	appear in the bibliography; so remember that anything you add to this file
	will be invisible in your document until you \cite{...} it. This bibliography
	database can be written and maintained manually (check the included example,
	or google bibtex to find a guide), but I highly recommend that you instead
	use some automated tool like Mendeley to generate it for you.

preamble/include.tex:
	This is where you should include new LaTeX packages using \usepackage{...}.

preamble/input.tex:
	This is where you declare unicode symbols that you wish to use in LaTeX.

preamble/style.tex:
	This is where you declare stylistic properties of the document, such as margins,
	headers, footers, and so on.

preamble/macro.tex:
	This is where you should define your custom LaTeX macros.

preliminaries/*.tex
	This is where the titlepage, abstract and preface of your document will be.

chapters/*.tex
	This folder should contain all the chapters of your document as separate .tex files.
	Remember that for every .tex file you add here, you should also add a corresponding
	statement \include{mainmatter/filename.tex} in master.tex for the contents to appear
	in the document.

appendices/*.tex
	This folder should contain your appendices as separate .tex files. Remember to add
	a corresponding \include{backmatter/filename.tex} in master.tex.
